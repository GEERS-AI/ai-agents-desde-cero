# Semantic Search

The following notebook is focused on showing how Semantic Search works as a natural next step after introducing vector embeddings and their use.

For simplicity, we are going to use a pre-trained embeddings model, it could be open-source or commercial, but it should be able to handle multiple languages.

For storage, we will use a vector database, it is important to note, we are inside a notebook, so we will use a simple in-memory vector store for demonstration purposes.

It would be nice to crawl a website or download information from wikipedia, we will use a small set of documents for simplicity.
